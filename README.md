# ☕ Cafe Sales Dashboard 📊

## 1. 🎯 The Goal
The goal of this project was to create a clear and interactive Excel & Power BI dashboard to analyze the sales performance of a real cafe.  
The project focuses on understanding sales trends, customer behavior, and menu performance to support data-driven business decisions.  

The dashboard helps answer key questions such as:  

- Which menu items generate the most revenue?  
- What are the daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends?  
- How do payment methods and locations impact sales?  
- Are there patterns in customer behavior and peak hours?  
- Which items or categories need attention for optimization or promotion?

**Data Issues:**
